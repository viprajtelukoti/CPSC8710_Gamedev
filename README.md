## Reflection

During the 1.5-month development period, we meticulously structured our workflow into four distinct phases of sprints. This division allowed us to efficiently manage our resources and focus on specific tasks and goals within each phase, ensuring a systematic and organized approach to our development process.

Phase 1 - Exploration and Planning:
During the initial week, our team delved into the project's requirements by thoroughly reviewing the specifications provided by our professor. We brainstormed various game ideas and themes, conducting research to understand the mechanics required for a successful game. The primary goal was to grasp the essentials of game development, setting the foundation for the tasks ahead.

Phase 2 - Initial Tech Stack Selection and Challenges:
In the second week, we embarked on the development phase. Initially, we selected a tech stack encompassing JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Node.js. However, we encountered substantial challenges due to limited familiarity with this stack. As a result, our team engaged in frequent meetings to address these hurdles, ensuring we could navigate them effectively while advancing the project.

Phase 3 - Transition to Python Flask and Task Allocation:
To overcome the challenges posed by our initial tech stack, we made an informed decision to transition to Python Flask, a more accessible and suitable programming language. During this week, we also divided tasks among team members, allocating distinct responsibilities to each member. This approach allowed us to streamline development, with one member focusing on creating the raw workflow, another on incorporating essential features, and a third on enhancing the user interface with CSS for a polished appearance.

Phase 4- 
Starting this week, we've introduced regular progress meetings and rigorous game testing. We're also conducting brainstorming sessions for new features. Plus, we've added a GitHub icon for enhanced collaboration.
